# Data_Visualisation
Scripts for the main chart types 

Data visualisation is a powerful tool for both data analysis and data science. By creating different types of charts, you can 
have a detailed look on the nature of the data and extract important information. 

Below I will demonstrate how someone can do this by using Python 3.5 and Python's Matplotlib library.

Basic information for each chart type:

Line charts: A line chart, is type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called connected by a 
straight line.

Scatter plot: A scatter plot is a type of plot which is used to display values for two variables for a set of data

Histogram: A histogram is the chart-type that is used to represent distributions of numerical data.

Bar chart: A bar chart is used to display categorical data. The variables are displayed as rectangular bars, where their 
heights are proportional to the values that they represent.

Pie chart: A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a 
pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it 
represents.

Box plot: In descriptive statistics a box plot is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their 
quartiles.

Violin plot: A Violin plot is similar to box plot with a rotated kernel density plot on each side. The difference of when 
comparing to a box plot is that they also show the probability density of the data at different values.
